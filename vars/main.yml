## All the below variables are REQUIRED

# controller:
#   fqdn:  # FQDN of the NGINX Controller instance
#   auth_token:  Authentication token for NGINX Controller
# environmentName:  # Environment the gateway is associated with

## NOTES:
## PEM: Because JSON does not support multi-line strings, you must replace binary line feeds with ASCII line feeds (`\n`). The private key data will be redacted in the response for all get and list requests.
##   example: '-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n MIICdwIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCAmEwggJdAgEAAoGBALSQBtRafNJtTqN0\n
##             <EXAMPLE_SNIPPED> nYiZq6TZUsHjfG2R9PlK6jsvno9O6amN96Al6ZSTTDjhr4VU7/RJ0p/cisiCboCX\n
##             4cCq6lFKpIpeZJI=\n -----END PRIVATE KEY-----'
##   Ansible YAML to JSON conversion handles this for you. 
##   Only if you keep the pipe minus '|-' in the example position after defining the key.
##   Also be sure to mind the indenting.
## RemoteFile: The path to the certificate bundle file. The file must contain the public certificate and may contain additional intermediate certificates.
##   example: /certs/www.example.com/example.crt

# certificate:
#   environmentName: # REQUIRED:  The environment where this certificate is used.
#   metadata:
#     name:  # REQUIRED: name of the certificate
#     displayName:  # Friendly display name
#     description:  # Complete sentence description

#       - tag2
#   desiredState:

#     privateKey: |-  # PEM, RemoteFile; The private key used to sign the public certificate.
#       -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
#        -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
#     publicCert: |-  # PEM, RemoteFile; The end-entity certificate, in PEM format.
#       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
#       -----END CERTIFICATE-----
#     password:  # PEM; PKCS12; The passphrase to use to decrypt the private key. Required if the private key is encrypted.
#     caCerts:  # An optional list of intermediate certificates in PEM format that are used to validate the public certificate.
#       - |-
#         -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
#          -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
#       - |-
#         -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

#     data:  # PKCS12; A base-64-encoded string that contains a private key, a public certificate, and, optionally, other intermediate certificates.
